1. Pankuri Khare (pkhare@mail.sfsu.edu)
Added new pages : login , register , chat and updated app.js page.
Login page is connected with login api , register page with register api.
Once logged in , chat page hits getAllUsers api and getConversations api.
In backend did not make much changes, MessageDao doesn't really serve any purpose, instead merged it with ConversationDao. 
Made changes to conversationDto , replaced some fields in it. Also added WebConfig directory in backend to allow requests from frontend.

# 💬 TeamLastMinute Chat Application

A full-stack chat app developed as the final project for our Computer Science course. This application allows users to register, log in, and engage in private conversations — all with a clean UI, emoji support, and backend validation. Built with Java (backend), React (frontend), and MongoDB (data layer).
